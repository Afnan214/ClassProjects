For this project, I created a C++ hotel management component consisting of modern C++ enumerations, a Guest class hierarchy, and a GuestManager class. I defined two enum classes, RoomType and GuestType, with specific behaviors for guest types. The Guest class, an abstract base class, encapsulates room and guest details, providing getters and virtual functions for room usage and additional income. Three subclasses of Guest (Family, Rockstar, and Businessman) inherit from Guest, each with its own characteristics.

Additionally, I implemented the GuestManager class, which maintains information about hotel guests, using vectors of pointers to Guest objects. The class features a parametrized constructor, methods for adding guests, checking room availability, calculating incoming profits, and determining earning efficiency. I also overrode the comparison operator to compare GuestManager objects based on incoming profit and ensured proper memory management to prevent memory leaks.
