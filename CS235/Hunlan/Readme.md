This project entails building an interpreter for the HUNLAN programming language, a minimalistic yet functional programming language. The HUNLAN interpreter, similar to interpreters for mainstream languages like Python and JavaScript, undergoes compilation using the "g++" command to create an executable named "hunlan." Users can run HUNLAN code stored in plain text files by executing "./hunlan filename.hun." If the interpreter encounters incorrect instructions in the code, it issues error messages with line numbers, such as "ERROR: Bad instruction in Line 28," where line enumeration starts from 1 and includes empty lines and comments.

HUNLAN is designed with simplicity in mind and features straightforward syntax rules. It accepts one instruction per line, permits empty lines, and recognizes comments marked with a "#" symbol. The language is case-sensitive and utilizes spaces and tabs as separators, allowing instructions to have multiple leading and trailing separators.

HUNLAN supports two data types: NUMBER (8-byte integers) and STRING. Variable declaration adheres to C++ naming conventions, and assignment operators, including "=", are used to assign values to variables. Numeric literals consist of digits, while string literals encompass any ASCII characters except double-quotation marks, with the literals enclosed in double-quotation marks (which are not part of the literal). Escape sequences in HUNLAN strings operate identically to C++ strings.

Mathematical expressions involving numeric variables and literals are permitted, with the operators "+," "-", and "*" (no division). Precedence rules apply as expected, but the use of string variables or literals within expressions is prohibited. However, assigning one string variable's value to another is allowed. HUNLAN does not include negative value literals but permits negative values for variables and expressions.

The language provides a PRINT command for displaying a single variable or literal of any type, with the prohibition of using PRINT with multiple variables or literals or supplying mathematical expressions as arguments. Lastly, handling multiple variable declarations leads to unspecified behavior, which means the program's response can vary, including crashes, error messages, or silent execution. Multiple variable declarations refer to declaring a variable with the same name more than once, and the program can react in any way it chooses.
