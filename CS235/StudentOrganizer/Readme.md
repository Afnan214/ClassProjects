This C++ program serves as a student data management system, allowing users to store, retrieve, and manipulate student records. The system ensures data persistence between program sessions by storing all records in a file on a hard disk. It operates in a terminal environment and responds to a set of commands.

Users can add student records using the "ADD" command, providing a student ID, name, and age as parameters. The program strictly follows the order of parameters to avoid errors. For instance, "ADD 67412 Smith,John 21" adds a student record with these details. The "FIND" command allows users to search for records based on specified conditions, such as finding all students with a certain age or student IDs greater than a given value. The program provides a flexible search mechanism using field names (id, name, age), relationship operators (=, >, <), and values. For example, "FIND age = 21" retrieves students aged 21. The "REMOVE" command deletes records based on conditions, such as removing students with IDs below a certain threshold.

The program also supports a "STOP" command to gracefully exit the application, ensuring that all changes made are saved to the hard disk. It adheres to strict input validation, detecting incorrect commands or situations like overflow for student ID or age values.

To achieve this functionality, the implementation follows object-oriented principles. It features a dedicated parser class for tokenizing user input and a manager class with separate functions for adding, finding, removing, and stopping operations. Additionally, there is a hard disk management class responsible for reading and writing student records to a specified file. The "main" function serves as the program's entry point, orchestrating user interactions by processing commands through the manager class while adhering to best practices in code structure and design.
