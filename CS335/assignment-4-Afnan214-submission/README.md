# Assignment-4-Code
This project was a little hard to approach at first because i didn't know how to get the comparators working let alone implement them into the sorting functions, but after a couple of attempts I was able to get them to work. The problem was that i was using them as --->  cmp<comparable>( a[0],a[1])  // eg. where i didn't understand that cmp<comparable> was the type itself. ---> cmp(a[0], a[1])  // was eventually what i changed my use of comparators to. 
Figuring out how and where to use the comparators wasn't an issue. Whereever there was a comparison that dictated whether and element is larger or smaller than another element, a comparator was used. 
The next issue that I ran into was that the order of my sorts were incorrect everytime the size is >15387... I didn't realize why that was and that took a majority of my time. But it ended up being an issue with my verifyOrder function. I didn't account for duplicates and i think after size 15287 duplicates are likely. All i had to do to fix this was add && input[i-1] != input[i] into my if statement that returns false in verify order.
An issue that I was unable to solve was that when sorting greater to least, and the size of vector is large >200000 it returns a segmentation fault. However I am unsure if this matters since gradescope accepted what I had.
